### Store Retrieve Data in Firebase Realtime Database using Android Studio

## What is Firebase Realtime Database?
Firebase is a service to applications, it provides hosting, NoSQL storage, real-time databases, social authentication, notification, and other services.

In this project, we have created a login and signup page in android studio using firebase realtime database so all our data will be saved for free! When the user signs up using a username and password gets stored in the realtime database of firebase.

For login purposes, the same credentials are checked in the firebase realtime database and if it matches with user credentials then it will lead you to the home screen otherwise it will throw an error as login failed.
